# Project 1a : Boggle Solver (in C)

## How to compile

To compile `spellcheck`

```
make spellcheck
```

To compile `onePlayerBoggle`

```
make onePlayerBoggle
```

## Testing using ./test.sh

Note the test file may take some time to run because of `valgrind`. If you are completing this project on replit, this may be quite, quite slow. I recommend you use smaller dictionaries and test different aspects of your program and avoid simply testing with `./teset.sh`
